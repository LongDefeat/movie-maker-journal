# Movie Maker Journal

Welcome to the Movie Maker Journal! This web app is for movie lovers and movie makers. This app serves as a way to catalogue the movies a user watches, 
journal their thoghts about the films they view, and eventually meet other movie makers around the globe with shared interests. 

# Motivation
The movie maker journal is a personal project for me to practice React and Node.js, but also to catalogue my own movie viewing experiences.

# Tech Framework
This app is built on React and Node.js and it utilizes the Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org) for the source of its movie data. The database
I've used to build the project was with postgresSQL, so some of the SQL was taken from my inputs on the postgres GUI. 

# Installation
To install, copy the repo and then input "npm install -i" in your chosen command line. 

# Usage
This project is purely for educational purposes for me, the developer.

# Contributing

While I am not actively taking contributions, any suggestions are more than welcome. This is an on-going project that I will be building with new features added
fairly frequently.
